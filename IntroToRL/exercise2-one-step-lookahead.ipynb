You will define these values in the code cell below.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/FBoWr2f.png\" width=80%><br/>\n</center>\n    \n\nTo check your answer, we use your values to create a heuristic function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_heuristic_q1(grid, col, mark, config):\n    num_twos = count_windows(grid, 2, mark, config)\n    num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n    num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n    num_twos_opp = count_windows(grid, 2, mark%2+1, config)\n    num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n    score = A*num_fours + B*num_threes + C*num_twos + D*num_twos_opp + E*num_threes_opp\n    return score\n```\n\nThis heuristic is then used to create an agent, that competes against the agent from the tutorial in 50 different game rounds.  In order to be marked correct, \n- your agent must win at least half of the games, and\n- `C` and `D` must both be nonzero.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# TODO: Assign your values here\nA = ____\nB = ____\nC = ____\nD = ____\nE = ____\n\n# Check your answer (this will take a few seconds to run!)\nq_1.check()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_1.hint()\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2) Does the agent win?\n\nConsider the game board below.  \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/AlnaQ3J.png\" width=30%><br/>\n</center>\n\nSay the agent uses red discs, and it's the agent's turn.  \n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_from the tutorial_**, does it win or lose the game?\n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_that you just implemented_**, does it win or lose the game?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#q_2.hint()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3) Submit to the competition\n\nNow, it's time to submit an agent to the competition!
